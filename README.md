## Important Information
1. You need to have a licenced copy of Axis and Oh's to use these templates. You can try out a free demo of Axis and Oh's to check if the templates work with your hardware. _NOTE:_ I am not associated or affiliated with Axis and Oh's or its developers.
1. The scripts are developed based on the model behavior definitions and internal LVars of the aircrafts. If the arcraft developers change the model behavior logic and/or LVars, the scripts may break. Please file an issue in this repository for any incorrect behavior of the scripts.
